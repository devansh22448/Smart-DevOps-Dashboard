Full CI/CD Automation & Deployment Monitoring Platform

A self-hosted, production-style CI/CD orchestration system that automates build and deployment workflows using native Git hooks, Node.js child processes, circuit breaker fault tolerance, Unix domain sockets for high-performance IPC, and a real-time monitoring dashboard.

This project simulates real-world DevOps tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD while remaining lightweight, customizable, and fully self-managed.

📖 Introduction
The Smart DevOps Dashboard is an automated CI/CD platform designed to streamline software build, deployment, and monitoring processes.
The system:
Automatically triggers pipelines using Git hooks
Executes deployments in isolated Node.js child processes
Streams real-time logs via WebSockets
Stores detailed deployment history in MongoDB
Implements circuit breaker protection to prevent cascading failures
Uses Unix domain sockets for efficient inter-service communication
It delivers full lifecycle visibility from code push to production rollout.


❗ Problem Statement
Traditional manual deployment workflows suffer from:
Lack of real-time visibility
Poor handling of concurrent deployments
Cascading failures during repeated deployment errors
No centralized deployment history
High operational overhead
Inefficient inter-service communication
These issues slow release cycles, reduce reliability, and increase system instability.


🎯 Key Objectives
Automate CI/CD pipelines via native Git hooks
Provide sub-second real-time deployment updates
Ensure safe concurrent deployments
Implement circuit breaker–based failure protection
Maintain complete deployment traceability
Enable high-performance IPC via Unix sockets
Deliver a secure, self-hosted DevOps solution

🔁 CI/CD Execution Flow
Developer pushes code to repository
Git post-receive hook triggers deployment script
Node.js orchestrator spawns isolated child process
Deployment logs stream in real-time to dashboard
Circuit breaker monitors consecutive failures
On repeated failures → deployments halted automatically
Deployment metadata stored in MongoDB

🗃 Deployment Data Model (MongoDB)


Example deployment document:

{
  "deploymentId": "DEP-2026-0021",
  "branch": "main",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "duration": "42s",
  "triggeredBy": "git-hook",
  "logs": ["Build started...", "Tests passed...", "Deployment successful"],
  "failureCount": 0,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-20T10:15:00Z"
}


Indexed fields:
deploymentId
branch
timestamp
status
This enables fast querying and historical traceability.

🛡 Fault Tolerance Strategy
The system implements a Circuit Breaker Pattern:
Tracks consecutive deployment failures
Trips after configurable failure threshold
Blocks further deployments temporarily
Automatically resets after cooldown period
Prevents cascading system crashes
This improves reliability during unstable release cycles.

🔐 Security Features
Password hashing using bcrypt
JWT-based authentication (1-day expiry)
Protected dashboard routes
Secure Unix socket communication
Environment variable configuration

⚙ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)
MongoDB (running locally)
Git (for hooks)
Linux/macOS (recommended for Unix sockets)

Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install

Create .env file:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smart-devops-dashboard
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=3

Start server:

npm run dev
Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Git Hook Setup

Copy post-receive hook into repository:

cp hooks/post-receive .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive

Now every push automatically triggers deployment.


🚀 Production Deployment
Build frontend:
npm run build
Serve static files via Express or Nginx
Use production MongoDB instance

Configure HTTPS
Secure Unix socket permissions
Enable process monitoring (PM2 recommended)


🌟 Unique Features
